# Parzen window and Knn estimators
The pdf of a random variable is given by: 
p(x)= 0.5, 0<x<2 
      0    otherwise

The pdf is estimated using the Parzen window and Knn estimators.
- Parzen window estimate uses a gaussian kernel, bandwidth of 0.05 and 0.2, 
  and is plotted using 32, 256 and 5000 points generated by a random number generator according to p(x)  
- Knn estimate uses 32, 64, and 256 neighbors and is plotted using 5000 points.
