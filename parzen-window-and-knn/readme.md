# Parzen window and Knn estimators
The pdf of a random variable is given by: 
p(x)= 0.5, 0<x<2 and 0 otherwise

The pdf is estimated using the Parzen window and Knn estimators.
- Parzen window estimate uses a gaussian kernel, bandwidth of 0.05 and 0.2, 
  and is plotted using 32, 256 and 5000 points generated by a random number generator according to p(x)  
- Knn estimate uses 32, 64, and 256 neighbors and is plotted using 5000 points.

# Parzen window and Knn classifiers
There are 3 classes having: P(x|ω1) = N(2, 0.5), P(x|ω2) = N(1,1), P(x|ω3) = N(3, 1.2)
and priors: P(ω1) = 0.5, P(ω2) = 0.3, P(ω3) = 0.2.

The following tasks are being executed:
- Create random train sample with 100 samples(features) based on above distributions and priors.
- Create random test sample with 1000 features based on above distributions and priors
- Classify test samples using knn algorithm, for k=1,2,3, and calculate error.
- Compare error to that of the Bayesian classifier.
- Use samples for classification using Parzen Windows. 
- Use atleast 4 different values for the bandwidth parameter h = σ (spread) 
  and choose the one with the best results
- Use samples for classification with Parzen Windows/Probabilistic Neural Networks.
- Use 4 different values for the bandwidth parameter h = σ (spread)
