# Iris dataset linear classifiers
The Iris data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). 
Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.
Iris Setosa is the only one that is linearly seperable from the others

The following tasks are being executed:
- Find a linear classifier seperating Iris Setosa from the others using:
  - batch perceptron
  - batch relaxation with margin
- Find a linear classifier seperating Iris Setosa from the others using:
  - least squares (with the use of the pseudoinverse)
  - least mean squares (Windrow-Hopf)
- Find a linear classifier seperating versicolour and virginica using:
  - least squares (with the use of the pseudoinverse)
  - least squares (Ho-Kashyap method)
- Find linear classifiers of all 3 classes using least squares(pseudoinverse) method and all features
- Find linear classifiers of all 3 classes for spaces (1,2,3), (2,3,4) using least squares method
- Plot the hyperplanes
